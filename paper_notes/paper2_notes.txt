estimate 3d structure from 2d image

related works:
method 1 - use CNNs to map source img to target img/viewpoints

problem with GAN approaches - don't represent 3d structures, so they don't generalize well

camera pose: 
- coordinate convolution (?)
    - adds 2 channels to conv filter for storing coordinates
        - necessary bc cnns are spatially-invariant
